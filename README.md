# Demand Generation Campaign Registration Landing Page
The purpose of this repository is to show my front-end design chops. The landing page was built on proprietary marketing platform and used proprietary software for table data sections. Data sections have been disconnected from the server and are displayed as html for design-view purpose. All client contact information and links have been removed from the code. Speaker names and images have been changed.

## Project Description
A demand generation campaign for B2B water wastewater industry that provided educational material in a the form of a resource hub for engineers, project managers, and directors specific to that industry. 

## How it Works
This landing page would be promoted to a targeted audience through a variety media outlets and emails. The prospects could scroll through the material to view each title's description. To download or watch webinars, they would be required to register to gain full access to all of the materials. Once registered and the log in page bookmarked, the prospect could log in to regain access to the educational materials, e.g. download whitepapers, watch on-demand webinars, etc. The resource hub log in page is a separate landing page and used vLookup to log back in.

**My landing page design for this campaign was created for one of my employers' clients, and shown in my design portfolio.
